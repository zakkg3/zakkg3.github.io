Kubernetes ClusterSecret 

Global inter-namespace cluster secrets - Secrets that work across namespaces  - Clusterwide secrets

ClusterSecret operator makes sure all the matching namespaces have the secret available. New namespaces, if they match the pattern, will also have the secret.
Any change on the ClusterSecret will update all related secrets. Deleting the ClusterSecret deletes "child" secrets (all cloned secrets) too.

Here is how it looks like:

```yaml
Kind: ClusterSecret
apiVersion: clustersecret.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: clustersecret
  name: default-wildcard-certifiate
matchNamespace:
  - prefix_ns-*
  - anothernamespace
avoidNamespaces:
  - supersecret-ns
data:
  tls.crt: BASE64
  tls.key: BASE64
```


## Use cases.


Use it for certificates, registry pulling credentials and so on.

when you need a secret in more than one namespace. you have to: 

1- Get the secret from the origin namespace.
2- Edit the  the secret with the new namespace.
3- Re-create the new secret in the new namespace. 


This could be done with one command:

```bash
kubectl get secret <secret-name> -n <source-namespace> -o yaml \
| sed s/"namespace: <source-namespace>"/"namespace: <destination-namespace>"/\
| kubectl apply -n <destination-namespace> -f -
```

Clustersecrets automates this. It keep track of any modification in your secret and it will also react to new namespaces. 


## installation

### Requirements

Current version 0.0.7 is tested for Kubernetes >= 1.19 up to 1.25

For older kubernes (<1.19) use the image tag "0.0.6" in  yaml/02_deployment.yaml

### tl;dr install

```bash
kubectl apply -f ./yaml
```

### step by step

To instal ClusterSecret operator we need to create (in this order):

 - RBAC resources (avoid if you are not running RBAC) to allow the operator to create/update/patch secrets: yaml/00_
 - Custom resource definition for the ClusterSecret resource: yaml/01_crd.yaml
 - The ClusterSecret operator itself: yaml/02_deployment.yaml || For **ARM architectures**: yaml/arm32v7/02_deployment.yam
 
 
## quick start:

create a ClusterSecret object yaml like the one above, or in the example in yaml/Object_example/obj.yaml and apply it in your cluster `kubectl apply -f yaml/Object_example/obj.yaml`

The ClusterSecret operator will pick it up and will create the secret in every matching namespace:  match `matchNamespace` but not matching  `avoidNamespaces` RegExp's.

You can specify multiple matching or non-matching RegExp. By default it will match all, same as defining matchNamespace = * 

### Get the clustersecrets

```bash
$> kubectl get csec -n clustersecret
NAME            TYPE
global-secret
```

### Minimal example

```yaml
apiVersion: clustersecret.io/v1
kind: ClusterSecret
metadata:
  name: global-secret
  namespace: my-fav-namespce
data:
  username: MTIzNDU2Cg==
  password: Nzg5MTAxMTIxMgo=
```

## Limit ClusterSecret to certain namespaces.

This can be archived by changing the RBAC.
You may want to replace https://github.com/zakkg3/ClusterSecret/blob/master/yaml/00_rbac.yaml#L43-L46
for a new namespaced role and its correspondent rolebinding.

Here is the official doc:
https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/

### Update a ClusterSecret object

This will trigger the operator to also update all secrets that it matches.

### Value From another secret.

With this we can tell ClusterSecret to take the values from an existing secret.
yaml/Object_example/value-from-obj.yaml have a working example. Note that you will need first to have the obj2.yaml applied (the source secret).

```
data:
  valueFrom:
    secretKeyRef:
      name: <secre-name>
      namespace: <source-namespace>
```

to-do is to specify keys or matched keys to only sync that ones. For now it will sync the whole secret.

### optional

overwrite the deployment command with kopf namespaces instead of the "-A" (all namespaces)

## Dev & Debugging.


**NOTE**: in **debug mode** object data (the secret) are sent to stdout, potentially logs are being collected by Loki / Elasticsearch or any log management platform -> **Not for production!**.

Overwirte deployment entrypoint (Kubernetes `command`) from `kopf run /src/handlers.py` to `kopf run /src/handlers.py --verbose`

## Dev: Run it in your terminal.

For development you dont want to build/push/recreate pod every time. Instead we can run the operator locally:

Once you have the config in place (kubeconfig) you can just install the requirementes (pip install /base-image/requirements.txt) and then run the operator from your machine (usefull for debbuging.)

```bash
kopf run ./src/handlers.py --verbose
```

 Make sure to have the proper RBAC in place (`k apply -f yaml/00_rbac.yaml`) and also the CRD definition (`k apply -f yaml/01_crd.yaml`)

## Build the images

There is makefiles for this, you can clone this repo. edit the makefile and then run 'make all'.

You will need the base image first and then the final image.
Find the base one in the folder base-image (yes very original name)

Running just 'make' builds and push for all arch's supported. 

### x86

```
cd base-images && make all & cd ..
make all
```

### ARM32v7 

In case you want it for your raspberri py:

```
cd base-images && make arm & cd ..
make arm
```
### Digests

latest = 0.0.7

docker.io/flag5/clustersecret:

0.0.7 digest: sha256:c8dffeefbd3c8c54af67be81cd769e3c18263920729946b75f098065318eddb1
0.0.7_arm32: digest: sha256:ffac630417bd090c958c9facf50a31ba54e0b18c89ef52d8eec5c1326a5f20ad

## Roadmap:

Tag 0.0.8:
 - [X] implement `source` to specify a source secret to sync instead of `data` field. (https://github.com/zakkg3/ClusterSecret/issues/3)

# Support
 
 If you need support, start with the troubleshooting guide: Run it in debug mode.
 You can open issues and we will try to address them. 

 That said, if you have questions, or just want to establish contact, reach out one way or another. [https://flag5.com](https://flag5.com) || nico at flag5.com
